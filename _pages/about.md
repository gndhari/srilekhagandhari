My doctoral research focuses on theoretical quantum information, with a strong emphasis on quantum characterization, validation, and verification (QCVV). I'm working on developing robust methods for analyzing and benchmarking quantum systems that challenge current roadblocks like correlated noise, as well as quantum tomography techniques to accurately characterize quantum states and processes. My broader interests include exploring quantum advantage, and scalability of quantum computers.
