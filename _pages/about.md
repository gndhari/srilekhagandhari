I'm Srilekha (pronounced _shree-lake-uh_), a PhD candidate in Physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I grew up in Hyderabad, India and got my undergrad in engineerign Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2019.

My doctoral research focuses on theoretical quantum information, with a strong emphasis on learning states and noise. I'm working on developing robust methods for analyzing and benchmarking quantum systems that challenge current roadblocks like correlated noise, as well as quantum tomography techniques to accurately characterize quantum states and processes. My broader interests include exploring quantum advantage, and scalability of quantum computers.

You can find the rest of my profile in the Education and Research pages linked in the top menu.

I'm planning to graduate in Fall 2025 and am happy to talk about full-time opportunities in quantum information. Please contact me at [gandhari@umd.edu](mailto:gandhari@umd.edu).
