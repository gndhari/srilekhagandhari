## Research Experience
### Graduate Research Assistant — University of Maryland (Aug 2020–present)
PI: Michael Gullans

- Developed quantum state tomography methods for continuous-variable systems and established precision bounds via analytical and numerical work.
- Studied the effects of non-Markovian noise on randomized benchmarking and worked on process tensor-based characterizations.

### Applications Intern — Atom Computing (May–July 2023)
PI: Jeffrey Epstein

- Characterized 2-qubit gates on a neutral atom platform and developed noise estimation theory using compressive Gate Set Tomography.
- Built optimal recovery circuits for subsystem error-correcting codes.

### Research Intern — Laboratoire Kastler Brossel (May–July 2018)
PI: Nicolas Treps
